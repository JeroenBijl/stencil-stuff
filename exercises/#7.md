### #7. Use all the components together

In the login.html you can start using all the components together. You can use the form for validation and inside the form use the input components and button that we have created.
To see what the login screen needs to look like you can reference to the folder ux-specs.
If you are finished and have all the validations in place, you can go ahead and create some more components yourself.

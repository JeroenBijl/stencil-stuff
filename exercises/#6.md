### #6. Use all the components together
- Add the following function to the cw-input-component.
-   ```
    private emitInputState(connected: boolean = true): void {
      this.inputStateChanged.emit({
        connected,
        disabled: this.disabled,
        valid: !this.error,
      });
    }
    ```
    And add the following functions:
     ```
    protected componentDidLoad(): void {
      this.emitInputState();
    }
  
    protected componentDidUnload(): void {
      this.emitInputState(false);
    }
  
    protected componentDidUpdate(): void {
      this.emitInputState();
    }   
    ``` 
    This will register the element when it's wrapped inside the cw-form. If you open the cw-form component, you will notice that there's a listener to the inputStateChanged event. On every change this function needs to be emitted in order to let the form know about its changes.
    
- In the login.html you can start using all the components together. You can use the form for validation and inside the form use the input components and button that we have created.
  To see what the login screen needs to look like you can reference to the folder ux-specs.
  If you are finished and have all the validations in place, you can go ahead and create some more components yourself.

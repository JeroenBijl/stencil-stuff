### #3: Events in text-input

- To access the changes in the text-input component we need to create events. 
- Add events for the following:
  ```
  cwBlur
  cwChange
  cwFocus
  cwInput
  ```
  and use Stencil's event decorator:
  `@Event() private cwChange: EventEmitter` 
- Create methods `onBlur`, `onFocus`, `onChange` and `onInput` and add this in every method: `this.cwChange.emit();`, according to the type of change.
- The onInput event also needs to have the following before the emit:
  `this.value = this.inputText.value`
   This is because the value on the component isn't updating automatically on a change in the input element. This is also why we set the @Prop value to mutable. This means we can change the value within the component.
-  ```onBlur={ () => this.onBlur() }
          onChange={ () => this.onChange() }
          onFocus={ () => this.onFocus() }
          onInput={ () => this.onInput() }```
- In the index.html in the folder of input-text you can add listeners to the elements that text-input will have and check if they are responding on them.

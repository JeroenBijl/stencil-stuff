### #1: Creating a card

Do a `npm start` to start the development server. The project can be accessed on `http://localhost:3333`
Go to `http://localhost:3333/src/components/cw-card` to see the component. You can edit the index in the cw-card folder to see the working of the component.
We will create an login screen with the use of components. You can start creating this login screen in `http://localhost:3333/src/login.html`.
In the folder ux-specs you can find some specifications for the components we will create. 
Card can be called a styling component, because everything that will be put inside the component, the card itself doesn't know about.
To achieve this we will word with slots.

As you can see in the `cw-card.tsx`there's an decorator with `@component`. The tag will be the name of the component and is always necessary. Optional is `styleUrl`, which will point to the styling sheet of this specific component. The property `shadow` can be used to enable the shadow DOM, for now the default value of this property in Stencil is turned off. 

- We need to create two slots. One will be for a header and one will be the form content. 
- Add the following in the existing DIV:
-       <slot name="header" />
        <slot name="content" />
- In the index.html you can check if it's working by adding     `<h1 slot="header">Login</h1>`
- Header can be a `h1` with and be styled the way it should look, but there's also a possibility to create a component for this.

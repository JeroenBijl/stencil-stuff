### #4: Adding errors

- Add a function that's named `validate`. 
- Add the following in the method: 
  ```    
  this.error = this.inputText.validationMessage;
  return !this.error;
  ```
- Add the decorator `@Method()`. The @Method() decorator is used to expose methods on the public API. Functions decorated with the @Method() decorator can be called directly from the element. We need to have this for the validate method, because it will be used within the form component which also takes care of validation. 
- Add the validate() method to the onBlur(). 
  ```
    protected onBlur(): void {
      this.validate();
      this.cwBlur.emit();
    }
  ```
- Add a conditional statement in the render function for the error message.
  This will look a bit like: 
  ```javascript
  { this.error && <span class='cw-text-input__field__error-message'>{ this.error }</span> }
  ```
- To also give styling to the input field we can create a conditional css class by adding a variable with `    const cssMainClasses = `cw-text-input ${ this.error ? 'cw-text-input--error' : '' }`;` and give the div these classes like this: `<div class={ cssMainClasses }>`  
- Test if the error is triggered on an invalid input field in the index.html.

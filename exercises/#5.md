### #5. Creating the button component

- In the folder cw-button is a tsx file with no content yet. Create the component like the others and include a render function. 
- Add the following properties
  ```javascript
      buttonText;
      type, which can have type 'submit' | 'button' | 'reset';
      disabled: boolean;
  ```
- Add the following events:
  ```javascript
      cwSubmit;
      cwReset;
      cwClick;
  ```  
- Implement an onClick event like this:
  ```javascript
  protected onClick(): void {
    if (this.disabled) {
      return;
    }
    if (this.type === 'submit') {
      this.cwSubmit.emit();
    } else if (this.type === 'reset') {
      this.cwReset.emit();
    } else if (this.type === 'button') {
      this.cwClick.emit();
    }
  }
  ```
- In the render function create a button with a css class `cw-button` and a conditional css class when the property disabled is set on true.
- If you check the cw-form component, you can see how the form listens to the different type of events such as `inputStateChanged`, `cwReset` and `cwSubmit`. If you now put the button inside a cw-form component, the cw-form will listen to all the functions that a button is able to do (onReset, onSubmit, onClick)
